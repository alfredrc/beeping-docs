## Overview

Being a **Beeper** means wanting to collaborate on the project.

You can collaborate in several different ways in each of the public components:

- You can think of an improvement

- Can you offer an idea

- You can send information about issues, about bugs ...

- You can change the source code

- ... What you can think of to get better

## Channels

The channels we use for this type of thing are the official **Beeping** channels but more importantly is where we can build together.

## Github

Each of the components that are part of **Beeping** has an open repository on **Github**, and as such we are offered a direct channel that is the Issues section of each repository.

For each repository **you can create an issue** where you must indicate that what is being proposed is an idea, an improvement, a detected error ... or anything else you have in mind.

## Science

If **Beeping** has been designed under an **Open Source** model, it is to provide the scientific and technological community with a new magical communication protocol, but also to ask for their help in creating and solving the problems that we can find.

Doing all this work together will make this project a standard communication protocol and better day by day.
