## Overwiew

Below we show you a series of steps to be able to have the same vision when collaborating with the project.

## Steps

For the correct collaboration between all we must follow some rules to be all on the same page.

- Open an issue in the corresponding repository about what we want to contribute

!!! info "Issue"

    Opening an Issue does not only mean opening
    a task related to a bug, but in that
    same repository space you can add what
    that you consider may be positive for the project.

!!! info "Projects"

    Based on the content of these issues, especially in
    based on ideas and improvements new ones could be opened
    projects led by yourselves if so
    the scientific community considers it.

- Fork the repository with which we want to work

- Make a clone of the repository

!!! info "Clone"

    For the collaboration to make sense the clone must
    be made from the fork that we are willing to do. This
    way we can determine the changes made
    with the contributions of an engineers
    or a team of engineers.

- Once the changes have been made, a Pull Request must be sent

- At that time the project managers will be able to evaluate the changes and publish the improvement, if applicable.
