## Introducci√≥n

As we have commented in the introduction of this section, the **Core System** are libraries that are written in C ++ that are responsible for encrypting and decrypting the data that is transported by ultrasound.

These libraries are written in C ++ and are **Open Source**, so they can be compiled and modified by any engineer.

## Repositories

A single repository was unified with these libraries, although they have an effect on different components. That means that each of the components of Beeping may need one or more of one of these libraries as dependencies.

You can find all these libraries in the following repository:

* [Core System](https://github.com/beeping-io/beeping-core)

Within this repository you will see that there is a qualification per component that is affected by the **Core System** that contains within each folder the necessary source code for each of the components used in **Beeping** technology.

## Components

Here is a list of the components that are affected by the **Core System** and where to find the corresponding source code:

* [Beepbox](https://github.com/beeping-io/beeping-core/tree/master/beepbox)
* [iPhone SDK](https://github.com/beeping-io/beeping-core/tree/master/iphone)
* [Android SDK](https://github.com/beeping-io/beeping-core/tree/master/android)
