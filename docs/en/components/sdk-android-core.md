## Compile ( MacOs )

The Android SDK has a dependency on the **Core System** which is a library called **libbeepingcore.so**.

This library is compiled in the **Android SDK** component repository in the root folder

!!! info "libbeepingcore.so"

    This library for now supports the following
    operating systems:
    MacOS

!!! info "Brew"

    To perform the installation you need to have installed **Homebrew** on your Mac. 
    In case you don't have it installed, you can see how it is 
    installed in the following web page: https://docs.brew.sh/Installation

To compile this library you must follow the following steps:

- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/beeping-io/beeping-core)

    just open the Android SDK to work with the code
    source.
