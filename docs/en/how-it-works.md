## Introduction

**Beeping** is a technology that enables your Apps to send and receive information **through ultrasound**.

We call this ultrasound **Beep**.

## Beeps

A **Beep** is nothing more than an audio file, which when reproduced emits a non-audible signal to the human being.

A **Beep** transports data, and that data can be sent through any device that has a speaker.

To decode the contents of a **Beep** we need a device that has a microphone - **such as a Smartphone** - and integrate the appropriate **SDK** for each type of receiver.

## Potential

**Beeping** has been designed to be another communication option that offers us very powerful advantages today, such as establishing communications without the need for an Internet connection, or sending digital content in real time.
