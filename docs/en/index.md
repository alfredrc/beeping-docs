## Introduction

This is the starting point to **implement**, **participate**, **propose** to the community and **learn** this new sound-based communication protocol.

The vision of this project is the creation of a new communication protocol that is already capable of **transporting** data through **ultrasound**, with the aim of connecting devices to each other.

## ¿ What is Beeping ?

**Beeping** is a new **Open Source** communication protocol designed to transmit data between devices **over ultrasound**.

## ¿ Why ?

Sound is like water, it is everywhere. We can find speakers in most places, and that makes this technology cheap and can be used in cases where communication is difficult today.

In the [Use Cases](use-cases.md) section you can see where we have used the technology, but more importantly, it is the appointing of all of you to increase the possible use cases.

## Protocol

All standard communication **protocols**, such as bluetooth, HTTP ... and the best known in the world have been created with the **conformity** and **work** of the scientific community.

That is the main reason why we have decided to open the source code under an **Open Source** license. We understand that with the contribution of the scientific community we can reach together to create a consensus that is transformed into a **standard protocol** of universal communication.
