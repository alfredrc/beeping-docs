## Overwiew

This is the section from where we will publish the new **Beeping** projects that come from you.

This section will be divided into three parts:

- Issues or Bugs

- Improvements

- Ideas

## Issues

The issues section will be bug packages that are found.

## Improvements

The improvements will be ideas about what is already developed.

## Ideas

New ideas on how we can use this new communication protocol and therefore apply the necessary changes to it.

## Objetivos

Each of these packages will have an objective that has a scientific logic and that can be applied to a need.
